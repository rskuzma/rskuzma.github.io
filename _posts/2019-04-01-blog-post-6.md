[Article here](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/april/innovation-talk-cheap-start-innovating) in U.S. Naval Institute Magazine, the Navy's professional development publication established in 1873.

This details the efforts of the first Navy Algorithms Prototype Team and our work on behalf of the Navy Chief of Human Resources. Our prototype Navy talent marketplace tool improved top-10 prefence matches between Sailors and jobs by 40% over the current human system and the commonly used deferred acceptance algorithm. Our $5,000 solution outperformed multi-million-dollar contracting efforts. We advocated more Sailors be given the time, tools, and topcover to solve problems at the point of need and bring better digital solutions to the Navy.
