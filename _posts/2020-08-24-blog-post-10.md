Military technologists (software developers, data scientists, product managers) are a small talent pool and shoehorned into a legacy human resources system that is a relic of the industrial age and manages Soldiers in a "one-size-fits-all" mentality. We advocate for the creation of a "Digital Corps" to recruit, develop, and manage digital technologists akin to the military Medical Corps where doctors are evaluated by other doctors and you would never fill a job for a cardiac surgeon with an orthopedic surgeon.

This article influenced Federal Government policy and became the basis for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence [(NSCAI) Report Chapter 6](https://reports.nscai.gov/final-report/chapter-6/), particularly the recommendation that "Create Digital Corps for Cabinet-Level Departments and Select Agencies to Organize the Government’s Technical Workforce." It also led to the creation of the Army's Technology Corps, a career track managed by the Army Futures Command.
