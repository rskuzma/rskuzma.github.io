We try to convince Defense Department leaders that the military must commit to responsible and ethical artificial intelligence use not only because it is the right thing, but because it will sour relationships with industry and engineers if it does not. We offer concrete policy recommendations like creating more open dialogs with experts from academia and industry, integrate outside AI ethics expertise into military teams building AI systems, and leting military AI developers do "tours with industry"--working in the private sector to understand best practices.
