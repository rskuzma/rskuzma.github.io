We argue that the Army is only paying lip service to accelerating artificial intelligence adoption because it hamstrings data scientists and machine learning researchers from easily accessing data and compute resources and using modern development environments and software libraries due to bureaucratic red tape and old policies. We offer quick-fix solutions to these problems to help digital talent within the military better do their jobs and achieve real outcomes for users.
