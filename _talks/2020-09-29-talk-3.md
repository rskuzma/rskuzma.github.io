As the Defense Department adopts to 21st century technology it must adapt its talent paradigm. In this podcast, I talk about how the DoD is transforming its recruiting and training programs to bring in and create top-level talent. We also talk about how the Army plans to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) by collaborating with academia and industry and the need for organizations to enable their digital talent with the right tooling and digital infrastructure to work on tough AI problems.
