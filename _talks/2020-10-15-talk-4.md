Panel discussion on the challenges associated with talent management in the future Army. We discuss how Army needs to re-weight the importance of physical vs intellectual skills and how the Army is not effectively communicating the value proposition of serving in uniform versus working in Silicon Valley. People will take mission over money, but the Army must better communicate its hard problems and provide the talent in uniform the right tooling and authority to solve these problems.
