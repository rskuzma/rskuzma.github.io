Presented a NLP pipeline 1,000x speed-up of document exploitation (from days to minutes) of captured battlefield documents by intelligence analysts. OCR, translation, zeros shot topic classification, summarization, entity extraction, and knowledge graph creation with no labeling. Used a variety of open-source tools including Tesseract for OCR and HuggingFace large language models for NLP. Finalist for the Eugene P. Visco for outstanding early career analysts.
