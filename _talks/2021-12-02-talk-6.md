We introduce a novel method for analyzing person-to-personcontent influence on Twitter. Using an Ego-Alter framework and GrangerCausality, we examine President Donald Trump (the Ego) and the peo-ple he retweets (Alters) as a case study. We find that each Alter has adifferent scope of influence across multiple topics, different magnitude ofinfluence on a given topic, and the magnitude of a single Alter’s influ-ence can vary across topics. This work is novel in its focus onperson-to-person influence and content-based influence. Its impact is two-fold: (1)identifying “canaries in the coal mine” who could be observed by misin-formation researchers or platforms to identify misinformation narrativesbefore super-influencers spread them to large audiences, and (2) enablingdigital marketing targeted toward upstream Alters of super-influencers
