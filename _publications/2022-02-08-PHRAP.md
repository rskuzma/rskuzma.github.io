title: "Algorithmic Identification of Potentially High Risk Abdominal Presentations (PHRAPs) to the Emergency Department: A Clinically-Oriented Machine Learning Approach"

excerpt: 'Older adults presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with abdominal pain have been shown to be at high risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. Yet, such presentations are poorly studied in national databases. Claims databases do not record the patient’s symptoms at the time of presentation to the ED, but rather the diagnosis after testing and evaluation, limiting study of care and outcomes for these high risk abdominal presentations. We develop an algorithm to define a patient population with potentially high risk abdominal presentations (PHRAPs) using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).'
