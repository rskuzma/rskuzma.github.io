This website is under construction!

I am a Data Scientist and Product Manager with experience building machine learning products and leading teams at the Department of Defense's most cutting-edge technology organizations ([Army AI Integration Center](https://armyfuturescommand.com/ai2c/) and [Defense Innovation Unit](https://www.diu.mil/)). I am a researcher with the [Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science under Professor Kathleen Carley. I also do applied ML work in the healthcare field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.

My research interests include NLP, computational social science, and misinformation.

In my free time I enjoy [writing op-eds](https://warontherocks.com/author/richard-kuzma/), hiking and playing table tennis with my fiancee, and playing basketball.
