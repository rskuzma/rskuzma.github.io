This website is under construction!

I build machine learning products and lead technical teams within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). I've worked at the Department of Defense's most cutting-edge technology organizations ([Army AI Integration Center](https://armyfuturescommand.com/ai2c/) and [Defense Innovation Unit](https://www.diu.mil/)) and also influence the DoD's technology policy through my writing [write op-eds](https://warontherocks.com/author/richard-kuzma/). 

I am do applied ML research at Carnegie Mellon within the [Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/) under Professor Kathleen Carley. I also do applied ML work in the healthcare field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.

My research interests include NLP, computational social science, misinformation, and healthcare.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, playing tennis with my fiance√©, and playing basketball.
